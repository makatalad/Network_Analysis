# Narrative Summary
# Setup Code
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#insert packages
library(igraph)

#read in boba_data csv and create it into a matrix
trial <- read.table("Boba_Data.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)

trial <- as.matrix(trial)

#create bi adjacency matrix 
boba <- graph_from_biadjacency_matrix(trial)

```

# Network Plot

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Analysis 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
